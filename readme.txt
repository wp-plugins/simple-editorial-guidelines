This plugin enables you to display a simple panel containing your editorial guidelines in the post edit admin to users of your choosing.

== Description ==
It’s no secret that guest blogging is a powerful way to add useful content and interaction to your site. Adding to this the fact that WordPress makes it easy to track and manage the editorial and review process, it’s little wonder why so many sites, large and small use the platform to power numerous writers.

One of the difficulties, however, is making a writer clear of your site’s writing guidelines. You could send around a PDF or even create a page on your site, but that can get a bit messy.

Features include:

- Change the color of the panel’s header to help match your site’s theme or to simply grab your writers’ attention.
- Specify the post types on which you want the editorial guidelines to appear.
- Specify the specific user roles for which you want the editorial guidelines appear.
